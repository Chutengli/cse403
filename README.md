# CSE403 Software Engineering

## Project: DubMap

#### This DubMap project will be an all-in-one campus map platform for UW that would allow for easy navigation between classes, access to on-campus dining information, and bookings/reservations to the UW buildings and facilities on campus.

##### Major features

- Map with clickable buildings, with navigation systems that can lead students to travel through different buildings.
- Adapt list of available buildings to reserve rooms into the userâ€™s choice of their major
- Reservation availability of each room of buildings synchronous to the UW Library system, with the description of each room, such as maximum people allowed and facilities included.
- For the room reservation system, find out whether students are allowed in the specific building. If not, suggest rooms with availability and permission.
- Based on the location provided by the user, search and display a list of dining places information sorted by distance.

##### Stretch goals

- Linked with MyUW, and automatically generate routine among each classroom per day, without human intervention.
- Try to suggest and lead students to an appropriate study place during the spare time between lectures, according to routine, time, and facility requirements, saving time for finding spots.
- Optimize facilities usage in general
